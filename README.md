# Magnet Clone
Magnet is window management application for MacOS. When I bought it, it was $0.99. Now it's $13 for the same thing ðŸ˜¢

[Hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon) is a set of Lua APIs for Mac. If you can follow their installation tutorial, use this script to mimic the keyboard shortcut behaviour of Magnet. Add these functions to `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua`
